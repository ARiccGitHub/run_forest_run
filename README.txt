    Last semester I coded, in java a small console animation, using key bord chatrecterts, called Run, Forest Run!
    and earlier this semester I created, in python, a similar animation called Dance, Forest Dance!
    Then I created a similar animation merging the previous one called Run Forest, Run! Mix.
    And finaly, I created the following similar animation.
    
                                            Ask Forest!

    Based on the Forest Gump movie.

   Create a small animation, using keyboard characters,
   in this simulation you can ask Forest Gump to run and dance for you.
