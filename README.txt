    Last semester I coded in java a small animation called Run, Forest Run!
    and earlier this semester I created, in python, a similar animation called Dance, Forest Dance!
    For this assignment I created a similar animation merging the previous one call:
    
                            Run Forest, Run! Mix 
		       Based on the Forest Gump movie.

  Create a small animation, using keyboard characters, of Forest Gump dancing and running on the console screen. 
  With sound effects.
